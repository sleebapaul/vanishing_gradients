    "This is a discussion on an old problem that hindered the Machine Learning research for decades, now partially solved using various methods discovered in last 10 years. The audience are expected to have basic understanding of Neural Networks and Backpropagation to reap maximum benefit out of the explanations followed.   \n",

    "## Neural Networks and Deep Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "We all are beholding the captivating wizardry of Deep Learning in various applications. With Deep Learning, tedious tasks of past like Translation, Image Recognition, Object Detection and Speech Recognition are now working par with human level accuracy. There must be some spell, Deep Learning is casting, to perform these sophisticated tasks, isn't it? :D \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's answer that question first, shall we? So, what is \"Deep\" is Deep Learning?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, it is the depth of the architecture or simply put, it is the number of layers we add to a shallow network to make it deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Title](images/nn_and_dnn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question is why more layers? \n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of layers increases, [deep networks can represent very complex functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf). It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the lower layers) to very complex features (at the deeper layers). Consider an image recognition example below. [As we all know, in image recognition, Deep Networks surpassed human level accuracy](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/may/13/baidu-minwa-supercomputer-better-than-humans-recognising-images).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Title](images/deep_net_learning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see, the initial layers can detect the naive patterns like edges, then middle layers learn more complex patterns like nose, lips etc. and finally, the deepest layers learn the entire face. Woo-Hoo!!\n",
    "\n",
    "So the point is, **depth matters** and it is helpful to learn more and more details from the input. Next time when we confront a complex problem to be solved by Deep Learning, what would be the first fix, if patterns are not learned well? Leo knows the solution :D \n",

    "## What is wrong with Deep Neural Networks ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in this world has it's price. Though, the power of deep networks is immense, training a deep network is not that easy. No, I'm not talking about the hardware limitations which is indeed a practical problem. But in litrature, there are many fundamental issues we face while training deep networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may get deluded a bit, thinking that these issues are due to complex architectures of deep networks. In contrast, root of these issues are linked with learning algorithms like backpropagation, we use to train them. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wait, what? Reputation of backpropagation is on the line? :o\n",
    "Yeah, kind of :D \n",

    "As we propagate away from final layer, the perturbation on network output will not reach the layers, even if reaches, the gradient will be too feeble to make an update. This issue get worsened when number of layers increases. Very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly because of this reason, thus making gradient descent unbearably slow. More specifically, during gradient descent, as we backprop from the final layer back to the first layer, we are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero. Gradient based methods learn a parameter's value by understanding how a small change in the parameter's value will affect the network's output. If a change in the parameter's value causes very small change in the network's output - the network just can't learn the parameter effectively. \n",
