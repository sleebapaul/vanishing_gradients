# Vanishing Gradient

Now let me tell you the story behind this whole tutorial on Vanishing Gradients. I wanted to write a tutorial on ResNets paper, but when started I had this feeling that without giving a proper definition on the problem we are going to solve with ResNets, the whole tutorial would be incomplete. So I started working on this tutorial, which you may find as a preamble to ResNets tutorial :D 

GitHub rendering on Jupiter Notebook sucks sometimes when it comes to latex equations. If you've problems regarding viewing the notebook, then please visit [this link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sleebapaul/vanishing_gradients/blob/master/vanishing_gradients.html).

Happy learning !
